# Where are you from?

Used arduino; where are you from directly into morse code. translated you don’t belong here into chinese, used chinese commercial code to translate it back into morse code. inspired by Visual poem by Fatimah Asghar and Eve L. Ewing “What They Say | How They Say It | What They Actually Mean” but thinking about the layers & politics of translation & the power of the user as they adjust the speed of the overlapping codes. 

For Algorithmic Art at Pitzer in Spring 2025.
